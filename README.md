# Module 18 Challenge

For the module, we were supposed to store data in blocks with Streamlit. When running streamlit, though, I kept running into the same error.

I tried to correct this error by using one of Streamlit's caching commands, st.cache_data or st.cache_resource, as directed. When I did, though, I received this message.

Because of this, I wasn't able to check and test the ledger.
